# Magento To Sentry Logger

The purpose of this project is to log the magento error and exception messages to sentry, too. This extension is an extension of the [Magento Logger module](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/Logger), so you need the Logger module to use the Sentry logger.

## Usage

Install the module and configure it in the backend: `System > Configuration > Advanced > Advanced Logger > Sentry Logger`
